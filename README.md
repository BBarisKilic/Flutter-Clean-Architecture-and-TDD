# <p align="center">Flutter Clean Architecture and TDD</p> <p align="center">Funny Number</p>

This repository contains a sample [flutter](https://flutter.dev/) project with implemented [clean architecture](https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html) using [TDD](https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2014/12/17/TheCyclesOfTDD.html). [Funny Number](https://github.com/BBarisKilic/Funny-Number) project, which previously has been written by me with an `MVC` design pattern, re-structured and re-organized for this purpose.

## <p align="center">Project Details</p>


Keeping code `clean` and `tested` are the two most important development practices. In Flutter, this is even more true than with other frameworks. Therefore, even `state management` patterns like `BLoC` are not sufficient in themselves to allow for an easily extendable codebase.

As proposed by `Uncle Bob`, we should all strive to separate code into independent layers and depend on abstractions instead of concrete implementations.

For this purpose, in this project, applied `clean architecture` using `TDD`. Thanks to [Reso Coder](https://resocoder.com/blog/).
